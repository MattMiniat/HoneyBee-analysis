# UTT-DataBC-Project-1

This is the Temperature data for Texas. This can be located in Weather_Texas.ipynb file. I took the information from api_pull.ipynb to compare bees to temperature. 

In the output_images folder, you can find the graphs that have been generated based off of Weather_Texas.ipynb. 

Please use Weather_Texas.ipynb as the main file for this section of Bee Project.
